# ru-thesis: Reykjavik University Thesis and Project Report Template
Thesis (B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D.) Template for Reykjavík University in Iceland
This is an attempt to massively simplify the Thesis, Dissertation, and Project Report template used by our university.

## References
One of LaTeX/Overleaf's big strengths is making sure citations and hyperreferences work.
### JabRef
The template author uses JabRef(https://www.jabref.org/) to manage his overleaf references.  The easiest way to keep this up to date is to use a git client to synchronize your reference (.bib) files locally to your computer, JabRef to update them with your new information, then use the git client to send those changes to Overleaf.

Overleaf's git feature is only available to paying accounts, so you will need to register a Reykjavík University email to your account in order to gain the benefits without paying for it yourself.  This can be done by adding a second email to your account and confirming it.

### Zotero
Zotero can be used to manage your references as well:  https://www.overleaf.com/blog/174-import-your-bibs-reference-management-tools-now-linked-to-overleaf-number-backtoschool#.WKLwrjuLRpg
