\begin{abstract}
  The goal of this template is to produce electronic output to be uploaded to Skemman that can be later printed out and bound into a professional looking textbook that fits on standard library shelves.
  It is important to note that A4 paper when bound requires taller shelf spacing, so the B5 paper format was chosen instead.
  When binding a book, the edges that face outward need to be very smooth to reduce contamination and dust from entering the book when it sits on a shelf; this is why traditionally a larger paper size is cut down to the book size.
  If your print house expects the stock to be A4, then make sure the rubook has the ``a4paper'' option.
  If they prefer to deal with preparation themselves from a B5 pdf, then the default ``b5paper'' option is correct.
  The template is optimized for lualatex, but should still work with pdflatex.
  
  The abstract goes here in English or Icelandic.
  It should be a fairly short summary of the entire document.
  If you switch to Icelandic mode (IS option to ruthesis) then abstract will become \'{U}tdr\'{a}ttur

  Keywords / Efnisord:  Keywords, separated, by, commas
